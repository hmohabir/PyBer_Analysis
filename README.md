# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
Analysis performed with the usage of ride sharing data from PyBer to provide a visualization of how ride sharing varies between the various landscapes â€“ Urban, Suburban and Rural. 

## Result

The data reflects the ride sharing trends in the various landscapes. Ride sharing is most accessable in the denser population of urban cities and is least accessable in the Rural environment. The summary shows that rural cities had 124 total rides when compared to 1625 in Urban cities. There is an inverse relationship betweeb teh total rides, average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The farther one gets from the Urban city, the higher the fare per ride. The same is true for the average fare per driver. 


The results of data are much easily understood with the graph below as it shows the disparity of ride-sharing services across the three different city types, and it clearly demonstrates what are most likely accessibility-influenced trends.  alt text

In addition, the following graph shows the disparity of fares per city type:

Note the higher fares generated in Urban environments vs rural ones. Also, the graph shows the fare rise/fall on a weekly basis for the period.

## Summary

Based on the results, a couple of reccommendations can be made:

1) The fare per ride is higher in rural cities. This might be due to the longer rides. Decrease the fare in rural cities, and increase it in urban cities to rebalance the fares.

2) Increase the number of drivers in rural cities. With more drivers, the rides would also increase.

3) Offer cheaper rides during the weeks where there are dips in the graph. This would encourage riders to take advantage of the lower fares and utalize the ride sharing even more.
